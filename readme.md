This paper proposed an entanglement-based metric - vertex entanglement (VE) - quantifying local perturbations on spectral entropy, with superior applications in network dismantling and brain network analysis.

# Repo Contents

1. data
2. src: source code of VE
   - **VE.py**: python version implementation
   - VE.m: matlab version implementation
   - reinsertion.py 
   - GNDR.py: The original GND code is not in Python, and it is not adapted for non-connected graphs. We provide a Python version of the GND algorithm. 
3. utils: basic utils used in the src code


# Basebline methods implementation
We used the source codes released online, and adopted the best parameter settings provided by authors (if available) for each method.
