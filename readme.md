This paper proposed an entanglement-based metric - vertex entanglement (VE) - quantifying local perturbations on spectral entropy, with superior applications in network dismantling and brain network analysis.




# Repo Contents

1. data
   - please put your dataset in the following directory `'./data/{data_name}/edges.txt'`
2. src: source code of VE
   - **VE.py: python version implementation of our algorithm**
   - reinsertion.py:  this algorithm can reinsert nodes that 
   - GNDR.py: The original GNDR code is not in Python, and it is not adapted for non-connected graphs. We provide a Python version of the GNDR algorithm. 
3. utils: basic utils used in the src code


# Reproduce results

 Run `VE.py` directly to reproduce the dismantling results in our paper.

- The resulting list of moving nodes is given in `'./results/{data_name}/VER_nodelist.txt'`
- The resulting GCC change list corresponding to the given removing nodes list is reported in `'./results/{data_name}/VER_gcc.txt'`
- Change `netname` to conduct experiments for different datasets. Note that your dataset should put the edge list in the following directory `'./data/{data_name}/edges.txt'`


# Basebline methods implementation
We used the source codes released online, and adopted the best parameter settings provided by authors (if available) for each method.
